# UnityChessGame

## Overview

UnityChessGame is a Unity-based chess game project containing the Unity project files and C# scripts for gameplay. This README provides instructions for opening, running, and extending the project, plus notes about dependencies and common tasks.

*Repository inspected:* the project at the provided GitHub link (Unity project layout: `Assets`, `Packages`, `ProjectSettings`, etc.). ([GitHub][1])

## Features

> (Adjust these to match the actual implemented features in the project.)

* Two-player chess gameplay (local).
* Chess piece movement and rules enforcement (legal moves, captures, check/checkmate detection).
* Visual board and piece prefabs implemented in Unity.
* Basic UI for turn display and move history (if present in the project).
* Save/load or undo (if present — please confirm and I’ll add specifics).

---

## Requirements & Dependencies

* Unity Editor — recommended version: **specify your Unity version** (project contains Unity project folders). If you don't know the version, open the project in Unity Hub and it will recommend one. ([GitHub][1])
* Scripting: C# (Unity scripts).
* No external packages were visible from the repository root listing; if your project uses third-party packages (e.g., via `manifest.json` in `Packages`), list them here.

---

## Getting started / Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssuminski3/UnityChessGame.git
   ```
2. Open Unity Hub.
3. Add the cloned folder as a project (select the repository folder that contains `Assets`, `ProjectSettings`, `Packages`).
4. Open the project using an appropriate Unity Editor version (if you don’t know which — Unity Hub will show a recommended version).

> If the project contains a `README` or `ProjectSettings` with the `m_EditorVersion` field, that will tell you the exact Unity Editor version used. (I couldn’t find an existing README or a declared Unity version in the repository view — you can paste your `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` or `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` and I’ll add the exact version to this README). ([GitHub][1])

## Running the game

### In the Editor

* Open the scene that represents the main menu / game board. (If you have a `Scenes` folder inside `Assets`, open `Main.unity` or similar.)
* Press Play.

### Building a player

1. File → Build Settings → Add the main scene(s) to the build.
2. Choose target platform (Windows/Mac/Linux).
3. Click **Build** and select an output folder.

> I could not confirm the names of scenes included in the project from the repository listing I inspected — please provide the main scene filename(s) and I’ll add them here.

## Project structure (inferred)

```
UnityChessGame/
├─ Assets/              # Unity assets, scripts, prefabs, scenes (project contains Assets folder). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
├─ Packages/            # package manifest used by Unity
├─ ProjectSettings/     # Unity project settings
├─ Library/             # auto-generated (do not commit)
└─ README.md (this file)
```

Inside `Assets/` you will typically find:

* `Scripts/` — C# scripts (game logic, piece behavior, UI controllers)
* `Prefabs/` — chess piece prefabs
* `Scenes/` — Unity scenes (board, menu)
* `Materials/`, `Textures/`, `Audio/` (optional)

If you want I can parse the `Assets/` folder and list exact script names and a short summary of each script (I couldn't fetch the internal file list due to GitHub view limits; if you'd like, upload a zip or let me fetch raw file paths and I’ll extract names and produce per-script descriptions).

---

## Usage & Controls

> Fill this based on actual project input scheme. Example defaults below:

* Left click on a piece to select it.
* Left click on a target square to move the selected piece (legal move only).
* Right click to cancel selection.
* UI buttons: `New Game`, `Undo`, `Save`, `Load` (if implemented).

---

## Configuration

* Board size and layout: configurable via `BoardManager` or similar script (if present).
* Piece prefabs: stored in `Assets/Prefabs/` (assignable in inspector).
* AI (if any): configure difficulty in `AIController`.

(Provide names of the relevant scripts or fields and I’ll replace placeholders above with concrete instructions.)

---

## Development notes

* Scripts are written in C#. Follow Unity best practices: use `SerializeField` to expose fields in Inspector, keep scene references assigned to components, and avoid hard-coded paths.
* Avoid committing `Library/` and other generated folders — they should be in `.gitignore`. If the repository includes `Library/` or other large autogenerated files, consider removing them and adding appropriate `.gitignore` entries.

---

## Examples / Screenshots

Add screenshots or GIFs of gameplay here for a nicer README. Example markdown:

```md
![Game board screenshot](path/to/screenshot.png)
```

If you want, upload screenshots and I’ll embed them and craft a README with them.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Project won’t open / version mismatch**: open `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` to find the Unity Editor version. Install that version via Unity Hub.
* **Missing scripts or errors on load**: ensure all required packages are installed in `Packages/manifest.json`. Reimport assets: `Assets → Reimport All`.
* **Large `Library` in repo**: remove it and re-commit without it — `Library` is auto-generated and bloats repos.

## Contributing

If you want contributors:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/awesome`.
3. Make changes, commit, and open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

Please include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` if you want specific contribution guidelines.

I could not find a license file in the repository view. Adding a license is recommended (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.). If you tell me which license you prefer, I’ll add a License section and the license file contents. ([GitHub][1])
